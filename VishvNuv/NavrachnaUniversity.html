        <p><b>Learn about the history, mission, and values that make Navrachna University unique.</b></p>
        <p><b>Traditionally, the purpose of college education has been to create individuals who know everything about something.
            Unfortunately, this methodology also results in individuals who know little about anything else, except their subject.
            At NUV, we aim to create T-shaped personalities. Our students have working knowledge about a wide range of subjects and deep domain knowledge in one area of specialization. We enable this through three synergies - Synergy of Theory & Practice, Synergy of Faculty & Industry, and Synergy of Youth & Experience.</b></p>
